Implementing Stack using 1 Queue
​
I initially started solving the question with 2 queues but as I went solving I didn't even need the second one
**TIP** : Just go solve even with the naive approach , OTW you'll find the optimal one.
​
I had runtime errors with initalizing the vector size so take it in a integer first then use it elsewhere.
