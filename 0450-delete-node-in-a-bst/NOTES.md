**Hint 1:**
Find a Node ? -> BST Property
**Hint 2:**
The else part gets the *minimum val from RIGHT SUBTREE* as the right subtree has greater value so when replaced with minval the BST property is maintained
â€‹
**Caution:**
-> first handle if the val doesn't have child just attach the next child
-> handle NULL !
